\subsection{Pressure Measurement}

There are two pressure syringes to allow measurement of the bladder and abdominal pressures. The pressure sensors used (MS5840) are factory calibrated, so calibration is not required. The measured values are sent via the mainboard to the UI Software, a zeroing value is applied to the absolute values. The detrusor pressure is calculated from the subtraction of abdominal pressure from bladder pressure.
