\subsection{Uroflowmetry}

The uroflowmetry sub-system uses a cantilever loadcell to measure the force applied by the container and the fluid voided. The loadcells raw digital value will be sent via the main board to the UI software. The UI software then applies the loadcell specific constants to obtain the applied force. The applied force is then converted into volume using the specific gravity of infusion fluid that has been used. The UI software has a calibration protocol to obtain the required constants. 
Using the change in time and volume the UI software calculates the flowrate of fluid voided.
