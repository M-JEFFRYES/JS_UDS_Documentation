\subsection{Pressure Measurement}

Assumptions for pressure measurement calculations in Urodynamics Without Borders system.

Gravity has been assumed to be:
\gravityconstant

Water density has been assumed to be:
\waterdensityconstant


The pressure exerted by a static fluid column is given by the equation, the gravity and water density constants are used to express pressure in \cmhtwosymbol
\pressurefluidequation

The pressures used in all calculations are the gauge pressures (relative to atmospheric pressure) not the absolute pressures.
