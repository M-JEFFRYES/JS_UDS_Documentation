\subsubsection{Pressure Sensor Configuration}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Solder the pressure sensors to the PCBs
    \item Fix the male 4 pin DIN connector to the 4-core wire
    \item Cut a hole axially through the syringe plunger to allow the 4-core wire to pass through
    \item Solder the 4-core wire to the PCB (pressure sensor facing up)
    \item Mix the epoxy resin and use it to cover the PCB ensuring not to go over the aperture of the pressure sensor. The resin should form a seal at the top of the plunger to stop fluid passing through the hole cut to allow the wires to pass through.
