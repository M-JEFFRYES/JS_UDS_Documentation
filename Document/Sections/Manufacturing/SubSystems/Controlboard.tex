\subsubsection{Control Subsystem}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Solder the resistors in place. (Tight to the board and not intruding other components)
    \item Solder the PWM circuit components. (The transistor pins can be bent to 90 degrees to avoid it sticking up) 
    \item Solder the support pins to the 2 buck converters
    \item Solder the 3.3v connection on one buck converter and the 5v on the other
    \item Solder the buck converters to the designated spot (3.3v to the 3.3v spotâ€¦)
    \item Solder the DC barrel jack mount to the PCB
    \item Solder the support pins to the TCA9548A Multiplexer, the Arduino Nano and the 2 HX711 amplifiers
    \item Solder the TCA9548A Multiplexer, the Arduino Nano and the 2 HX711 amplifiers to the PCB
    \item Cut 6x10cm and 5x5cm lengths of 4 core wire
    \item Fix female 4 pin DIN connectors to the ends of 5cm lengths of wire
    \item Fix male pin connectors to the other ends of the 5cm lengths
    \item Solder the 10cm lengths of wire to the PCB (2 of the wires will only require 2 cores to be soldered)
    \item Fix female pin connectors to the other ends of the 10 cm lengths
    \item Cut holes in the waterproof casing just large enough to fit the female DIN connectors, the micro-USB connector, the DC plug and the switch
    \item Fix the female DIN connectors, the micro-USB connector, the DC plug and the switch in place
    \item Place the PCB inside and connect each of the male and female pin connectors
    \item Test the continuity of each female 4 pin DIN connector to the PCB to ensure that the pins are connected in the correct order
    \item Screw the waterproof casing lid on to finish

  \end{enumerate}
