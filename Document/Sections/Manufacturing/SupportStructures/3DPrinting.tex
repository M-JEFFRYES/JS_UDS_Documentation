\subsubsection{3D Printing}

If you have access to a 3D printer, then check (XX APENDIX x) to see the measurements used to create the STL files for the components. If your component parts have the same measurements, then use the supplied files. If component measurements vary then use the drawings to design your own, at the time of writing Autodesk provide a free version of Autodesk that can be used to design the parts and export to STL files for printing. Aim to use a stiff setting filament to optimise the transmission of load for loadcell measurement.
